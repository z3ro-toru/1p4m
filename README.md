In short, the mod adds a dozen different unique icons so you definitely won't lose your waypoints! To a large extent, this mod came about because of two already existing ones, but... the labels weren't always visible, so I started redrawing the icons. Basically, I try to draw them so that they are distinguishable and visible on the map. I especially recommend using the icons from “Alternative Map Renderer”.

Most of the icons were drawn by me, or taken from websites/google and redrawn =)
